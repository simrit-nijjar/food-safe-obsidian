title: "HACCP"
---
* A food safety plan a food premises operator integrates into all food preparation steps
* Self monitoring system that should be practiced by all staff
* Created by Pillsbury after being commissioned by NASA
* Food staff must continually record and document CCPs
	* Should be routinely audited by management
* Create a work-flow chart for each food item served for staff
	* Prevents [[notes/Food-Borne Illness]] by ensuring food is safe to eat
	* Educates food handlers on proper safety practices

## Acronym

* Hazard
* Analysis
* Critical
* Control
* Points

## Stages of HACCP

### Hazard Analysis (HA)

* Think critically of the food preparation steps
* Try to find everything that can go wrong with each dish
* Determine Risks to food
	* Consider Pathogenic, Chemical, Physical, and Allergen risks
	* *See [[notes/Food-Borne Illness]]* **(Types of Food Borne Illness)**

#### Questions to Ask

* Is it a [[notes/Potentially Hazardous Food]]?
* Does it require refrigeration?
* Will it be thawed?
* Does it contain priority allergens *(See [[notes/Food-Borne Illness]])*?
* Is it stored or prepared near a chemical?
* Is there equipment used to make the dish that could break down or have parts dislodge in the food?
* Does it need to be cooked to be made safe to eat?
* Once cooked, will it be served right away or hot-held throughout the day?
* Will left-overs be saved and reheated for another day?

### Critical Control Points (CCP)

* Points in food prep where risks can be controlled
* Usually **Time-Temperature** controls 
* See [[notes/Flow of Food]] for ways to control **Time-Temperature**
