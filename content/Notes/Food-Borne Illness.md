### Allergens 

> Causes an over-reaction of one's immune system. The body will assume a none-pathogen is a pathogen and creates an auto-immune response.

#### Food Allergy vs Food Intolerant

* Food allergy causes an immune response which causes antibodies to be produced to fight off the culprit food's protein.
* Food Intolerance is when one does not have the enzyme to tolerate a certain food, causing one to feel uncomfortable.

* Food allergens are not required to be controlled for in food handling enviroment.
	* If made aware of an allergy, the food handler will be held responsible for causing an allergic reaction.

##### How to Prevent Allergen Contamination

* Soap and Water are effective in removing allergens from food surfaces and hands.
	* Alcohol Hand Sanitizer will not work 
* Show the packaging the food was delivered within to the person consuming the food.
	* **Priority Allergens** will be stated on the packaging.
