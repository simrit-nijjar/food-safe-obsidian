title: "Potentially Hazardous Food"
Alias: PHF
---

* A food with the requirements needed to to allow [[notes/pathogens/Bacteria]] to grow quickly.
* Should be consumed within 2 hours of being cooked.

## Characteristics of PHF

* High in protein
* Neutral PH
* High in moisture

## Barrier Method

Remove one of the six needs of bacteria to grow. Creating a *barrier* between the bacteria and it's growth.

## List of Potentially Hazardous Foods

### Produce
* Non-hazardous food
* Can still cause FBI.
* Generally cannot support the creation of [[notes/pathogens/Bacteria]].
* Generally considered non-hazardous.
* Cut produce should be kept in a refrigerator.
	* The nutrients released while cutting can allow bacteria to grow.

### Bruised Fruits
* Pathogens can enter through the bruised portions of the fruit.
* Cut away the bruises.

### Unpasteurized Juices and Ciders
* [[Pasteurization]] is the best way to eliminate [[notes/Food-Borne Illness]].
	* Protects the most vulnerable from getting sick
* Unpasteurized foods significantly increase the chances of pathogens.

### Vegetable Oil
* Keep out of the *Danger Zone* (See [[notes/Temperature Abuse]])

### Meat
* Assume an raw meat (ground or whole) is contaminated by pathogens on the outside.
* Contamination typically occurs during slaughter.
* Burgers should be cooked until 71Â°C.
	* Use a [[notes/Probe Thermometer]] only.
	* Avoid colour change as an indicator for cooked meat.
* **Mechanical Meat Tenderization** makes undercooking whole cuts of meat more risky.
	* Pushes pathogens deep inside the meats.
	* All mechanically tenderized meats in Canada must be labeled (enforced by Health Canada)
