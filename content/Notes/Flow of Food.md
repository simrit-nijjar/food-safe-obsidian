title: "Flow of Food"
---
* Flow begins from the reception at supplier to customer
* Each step has a time and temperature limit
	* If not met, food should be discarded

### Time Range Sheet Sheet

* **Danger Zone**: 4°C to 6°C
* **Fridge Temperature**: Below 4°C
* **Freezer Temperature:** Below -18°C
* **Hot-Holding**: Above 60°C for 15°C seconds
* **Cooling**: 60°C to 4°C within 6 hours
* **Reheating**: Above 74°C for 15 seconds

## Stage 1: [[notes/Receiving & Storage]]

* Fresh potentially hazardous foods should be received at 4°C or lower
	* The upper limit of the **Danger Zone** *(See [[notes/Temperature Abuse]])*
* Frozen potentially hazardous foods should be received at -18°C or lower
	* Slows deterioration of foods
	* Destroys parasites and their eggs

## Stage 2: Thawing

* In the fridge
	* Every 4 lbs of frozen meat takes a day to thaw
* In the microwave
* Under running cold water
	* Keep water running at a slow pace to ensure water stays cold
* Cook in the frozen state
	* Cook above 325°F
* **DO NOT THAW ON COUNTER TOP**

### Warnings

* **ALWAYS** cook frozen stuffed turkey in the frozen state
* Avoid using a slow cooker for frozen foods

## Stage 3: Room Temperature Preparation

* Food is only safe to handle for 2 hours after being removed from the previous state.
* The 2 hour times does not restart

## Stage 4: Cooking

> 63°C to 82°C

* Destroys most pathogens

| Food                       | Temperature | Time Under Temperature |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Whole cuts of beef or veal | 63°C        | 3 minutes              |
| Fish                       | 70°C        | 15 seconds             |
| Pork                       | 71°C        | 15 seconds             |
| Ground Beef                | 71°C        | 15 seconds             |
| Chicken Pieces             | 74°C        | 15 seconds             |
| Whole, Raw Poultry         | 82°C        | 15 seconds             |
| Other/Combinations         | 74°C        | 15 seconds             |


## Stage 5: Hot-Holding

* Once cooked properly, food may be kept at above 60°C for up to 6 hours
	* Upper limit of the **Danger Zone**
* Use a probe thermometer at least every 2 hours to ensure constant temperature

### Hot Holding Units

* Buffet Tables
* Soup and Stew urns
* Chaffing dishes supplied with fuels
* **HEAT LAMPS DO NOT COUNT**

## Stage 6: Cooling

*  Food handlers are given a maximum of **6 hours** to cool through the *Danger Zone*
	* **Stage 1**:  Cool from 60°C to 20°C within 2 hours.
	* **Stage 2**: Cool from 20°C to 4°C within 4 hours.
* Food can be cooled properly by:
	* Dividing into smaller portions
	* Placing into shallow containers
		* Preferably stainless steel
	* Refrigerating immediately
	* Stirring Frequently 

> *See [[notes/FAT TOM]]* **(TIME)**

## Stage 7: Reheating

* Food should be reheated to an internal temperature of at least 74°C for 15 seconds 
* Reheating process should not take more than 2 hours
* Reheating should be done either on the stove, or the microwave
