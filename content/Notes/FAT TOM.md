* The six things required for a pathogen to grow.
* Controlling for at least one of these can help prevent [[Food-Borne Illness]].
 
## Food

* Like the protein for bacteria.
* Also includes *carbs*

## Acidity

* Foods with a PH above 4.5 are considered neutral.
* Includes:
	* Meats
	* Veggies
	* Cheeses
	* Eggs
	* Dairy

## Time

* You have **2 hours** after cooking to eat a [[Potentially Hazardous Food]]
* If the ambient temperature is above 32° C, the **2 hour rule** becomes the **1 hour rule**.

## Temperature 

* 4 - 60° C allows bacteria to grow quickly.
	* 37° C is most dangerous temperature.
	* (See [[Temperature Abuse]])
* Pre-cooked foods should always be monitored while cooling.
* Food handlers are given a maximum of **6 hours** to cool through the *Danger Zone*
	* **Stage 1**:  Cool from 60°C to 20°C within 2 hours.
	* **Stage 2**: Cool from 20°C to 4°C within 4 hours.
* Food can be cooled properly by:
	* Dividing into smaller portions
	* Placing into shallow containers
	* Refrigerating immediately
	* Stirring Frequently 

> Time-Temperature control is the most effective measure in the control of bacterial growth.

## Oxygen

* Aerobic bacteria need oxygen to grow.
	* **Ex**. Salmonella and E. Coli
* Anaerobic bacteria need lack of oxygen to grow.
	* **Ex**. Botulinum Spores (See [[notes/pathogens/Bacteria]])
* Adjusting the oxygen of a food can drastically affect the food risky risk in either direction

## Moisture

* Bacteria requires water to grow.
* **Available Water**: Water in its pure state
	* When combined with salt or sugar, its creates a larger compound that is useless to bacteria
	* One way to do reduce available water is to freeze food. Will be undone once thawed.
	* Another way is to dry out the food.
