## Spore State

Some bacteria can enter a **Spore State** where they do not grow but still survive.

* Instead of dying when missing the 6 elements needed for pathogens to survive, these bacteria enter a spore state.
* Can stay in this state for a very long time, until normal growth conditions return.
* When multiplying, they'll create **toxin** (a disease-causing substance).
* Toxin is usually just passed through the body and released through fecal matter.
* They can **NOT** be easily destroyed by sanitizers and regular cooking temperatures.
* Reheating food that has experienced [[Temperature Abuse]] will **NOT** make the food safe to eat.

### Clostridium Botulinum
* A type of pathogen spore that causes disease from its toxin.
* The disease caused by this pathogen's toxin is called *Botulism*.
* Most risk is caused by improperly canned foods, like homemade canned vegetables.
* Botulinum spores have a preference for a non-oxygen environment (**Anaerobic**).
	* Boiling canned foods can increase the risk of Botulism.
	* Cans heated to over 120Â°C have killed all Botulism spores.

### Preventing Botulism (and other Toxins)
* Foods should have a PH level of **BELOW 4.5**
* Foods are considered too acidic for pathogens to grow well
* This is all that is required to prevent Botulism

## Pathogenic Bacteria

### Bacterial Infection

* Ingestion of pathogenic bacteria which results in their tissue invasion.
	* Does not relate to ingestion of **Bacterial Toxin**
* Usually the result of undercooking [[Potentially Hazardous Food]] or contamination.
* Takes at least a day or more to show symptoms.
* **Symptoms Include**: 
	* Diarrhea (bloody)
	* Cramps
	* Fever
* **Common Culprits Include**: 
	* Salmonella
	* E.coli
	* Campylobacter.

### Bacterial Intoxication

* Illness caused by the ingestion of **Bacterial Toxin**
	* Does not relate the ingestion of living microorganisms.
* Usually the result of [[Temperature Abuse]] of [[Potentially Hazardous Food]].
* Takes minutes to hours to show symptoms.
* **Symptoms Include:** 
	* Vomiting
	* Nausea
* **Common Culprits Include**: 
	* Staph Aureus (See [[Understanding Microorganisms]])
	* C. Botulinum (See above)
	* Bacillus Cereus
